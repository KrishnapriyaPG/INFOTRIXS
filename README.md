Weather Checking Program using API keyüå•Ô∏è

This code sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API, passing the city name and API key as query parameters. The API returns a JSON object containing the current weather data for the specified city. The code then parses the JSON data and returns it as a Python dictionary.

Once you have retrieved the weather data from the API, you can process it in Python to extract the information you need. For example, you might want to extract the current temperature. The specific information available will depend on the API you are using.

If you want to create the city into your favourite list then type create, to display the favorite list type display and update, delete options are also there..
